                                <p>Given to St John's College by Bishop Thomas Watson of St Davids
                                    (bishop 1687-1699), a benefactor of the College (Yardley,
                                    _Menevia Sacra_ pp. 118-19, 384). Written <origDate>before 1717,
                                        when Watson died, and probably before 1699, when he was
                                        deprived of his bishopric, as it may have been difficult for
                                        him to acquire it thereafter.</origDate> Remains in Old
                                    Library at St Johns College. Consulted by Yardley in compiling
                                    _Menevia Sacra_ (1739-1769); page numbers align with those given
                                    in his digest of the statutes (National Library of Wales,
                                    SDCh/B/31).</p>
